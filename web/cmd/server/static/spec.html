                <p class="doc-intro">A workflow specification for autonomous agents. Version 0.5</p>

                <!-- Purpose -->
                <section class="doc-section" id="purpose">
                    <h2>Purpose</h2>
                    <p>Simplex is a specification for describing work that autonomous agents will perform. It captures what needs to be done and how to know when it's done, without prescribing how to do it. Simplex is optimized for high-fidelity interpretation by large language models.</p>
                    <p>The motivation is practical. When agents work autonomously for extended periods, they need instructions that are complete enough to act on without clarification, yet flexible enough to allow implementation choices. Simplex occupies this middle ground between natural language (too ambiguous) and programming languages (too prescriptive).</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Pillars -->
                <section class="doc-section" id="pillars">
                    <h2>Pillars</h2>
                    <p>Five pillars guide Simplex.</p>

                    <p><strong>Enforced simplicity.</strong> Simplex refuses to support constructs that would allow specifications to become unwieldy. If something cannot be expressed simply, it must be decomposed into smaller pieces first. This is a feature, not a limitation. Complexity that cannot be decomposed is complexity that is not yet understood.</p>
                    <p><em>Note: Enforcement happens through tooling, not the specification itself. A Simplex linter flags overly complex constructs (lengthy RULES blocks, excessive inputs, deep nesting) and rejects them. The specification defines what simplicity means; tooling enforces it. See the Linter Specification section.</em></p>

                    <p><strong>Syntactic tolerance, semantic precision.</strong> Simplex allows for formatting inconsistencies, typos, and notational variations. Agents interpret what you meant, not what you typed. However, the meaning itself must be unambiguous. If an agent would have to guess your intent, the specification is invalid. Sloppy notation is acceptable; vague meaning is not.</p>
                    <p><em>Note: Semantic precision is validated through example coverage. If examples do not exercise every branch of the rules, or if examples could be satisfied by multiple conflicting interpretations, the specification is ambiguous and invalid. See Validation Criteria.</em></p>

                    <p><strong>Testability.</strong> Every function requires examples. These are not illustrations; they are contracts. The examples define what correct output looks like for given inputs. An agent's work is not complete until its output is consistent with the examples.</p>

                    <p><strong>Completeness.</strong> A valid specification must be sufficient to generate working code without further clarification. This is what distinguishes Simplex from a prompting approach. There is no back-and-forth, no &ldquo;what did you mean by X?&rdquo; The spec must stand alone.</p>

                    <p><strong>Implementation autonomy.</strong> Simplex describes behavior and constraints, never implementation. Algorithms, data structures, and technology choices belong to agents. If a spec needs persistent storage, it says so. Whether that becomes a graph database, file system, or something else is the agent&rsquo;s concern. The spec neither prescribes nor cares.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Interpretation Model -->
                <section class="doc-section" id="interpretation-model">
                    <h2>Interpretation Model</h2>
                    <p>Simplex has no formal grammar. There is no parser, no AST, no compilation step. Agents read specifications as semi-structured text and extract meaning directly.</p>
                    <p>This is intentional. A formal grammar would contradict the principle of syntactic tolerance. It would also add complexity and create failure modes. Since Simplex exists for LLM interpretation, it should be native to how LLMs work.</p>
                    <p>Instead of grammar rules, Simplex uses landmarks. Landmarks are structural markers that agents recognize and orient around. They are all-caps words followed by a colon. Content under a landmark continues until the next landmark or the end of the document.</p>
                    <p>Agents scan for landmarks, extract the content associated with each, and build understanding from there. Unrecognized landmarks are ignored rather than rejected, which provides forward compatibility as Simplex evolves.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Landmarks -->
                <section class="doc-section" id="landmarks">
                    <h2>Landmarks</h2>
                    <p>Simplex defines sixteen landmarks. Five describe structure. Eleven describe functions.</p>

                    <h3>Structural Landmarks</h3>

                    <div class="landmark-detail">
                        <code class="landmark-key">DATA</code>
                        <p><strong>DATA</strong> defines the shape of a type. It names a concept and lists its fields with descriptions and constraints. DATA blocks help agents understand what they are working with, but they are optional. If a function's inputs and outputs are clear from context, explicit DATA definitions are unnecessary.</p>
                        <pre><code>DATA: PolicyRule
  id: string, unique, format "XXX-NNN"
  rule: string, the policy statement
  severity: critical | warning | info
  tags: list of strings
  example_violation: string, optional
  example_fix: string, optional</code></pre>

                        <p><strong>DATA as Output Schema.</strong> When a function's return type references a DATA block, that DATA block acts as a <strong>required output schema</strong>. Agents must produce outputs that conform to the schema—no missing required fields, no unexpected fields, no type mismatches. This significantly reduces output variance.</p>
                        <pre><code>DATA: Response
  status: success | error
  data: any, present when status=success
  message: string, present when status=error
  timestamp: ISO8601 datetime, required
  request_id: UUID, required

FUNCTION: process_request(input) → Response</code></pre>

                        <p>When the return type explicitly references a DATA block, the function's output is constrained to match that schema exactly. Agents must not improvise output structure.</p>

                        <p>DATA blocks can specify:</p>
                        <ul class="doc-list">
                            <li><strong>required fields</strong>: must always be present (default)</li>
                            <li><strong>optional fields</strong>: marked with <code>optional</code>, may be absent</li>
                            <li><strong>conditional fields</strong>: present under specified conditions</li>
                            <li><strong>field types</strong>: primitives, enums, references to other DATA blocks, or <code>any</code></li>
                            <li><strong>format constraints</strong>: patterns, ranges, or explicit value sets</li>
                        </ul>

                        <pre><code>DATA: StrictOutput
  result: number, required, range 0-100
  confidence: high | medium | low, required
  details: list of Finding, optional
  metadata: any, not allowed

DATA: Finding
  line: positive integer, required
  message: string, required, max 200 chars
  severity: error | warning | info, required</code></pre>

                        <p>The <code>not allowed</code> annotation explicitly prohibits a field, preventing agents from adding unexpected metadata or debug information to outputs.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="landmark-detail">
                        <code class="landmark-key">CONSTRAINT</code>
                        <p><strong>CONSTRAINT</strong> states an invariant that must hold. Unlike function-specific rules, constraints apply broadly. They describe conditions that should never be violated, regardless of which function is executing.</p>
                        <p>Constraints serve as <strong>behavioral anchors</strong>—they reduce implementation variance by specifying what must remain true regardless of how an agent chooses to implement the work. Well-crafted constraints narrow the space of valid implementations without prescribing a specific approach.</p>
                        <pre><code>CONSTRAINT: policy_ids_must_exist
  any policy ID referenced anywhere must exist in the registry</code></pre>

                        <p>Constraints can specify:</p>
                        <ul class="doc-list">
                            <li><strong>State invariants</strong>: conditions that must hold before, during, and after execution</li>
                            <li><strong>Output guarantees</strong>: properties that all outputs must satisfy</li>
                            <li><strong>Boundary conditions</strong>: limits on what outputs may contain</li>
                        </ul>

                        <pre><code>CONSTRAINT: output_format_stable
  output structure must match the DATA schema exactly
  no additional fields may be added
  no fields may be omitted unless marked optional in DATA

CONSTRAINT: idempotency
  calling the function twice with identical inputs produces identical outputs
  no cumulative side effects from repeated calls</code></pre>

                        <p>The more precise your constraints, the less variance in agent implementations. Vague constraints like "output should be reasonable" provide no anchoring. Specific constraints like "output must be valid JSON matching the Response schema" anchor behavior effectively.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="landmark-detail">
                        <code class="landmark-key">FUNCTION</code>
                        <p><strong>FUNCTION</strong> introduces a unit of work. It names an operation, lists its inputs, and declares its return type. The function block contains nested landmarks that specify behavior, completion criteria, and test cases.</p>
                        <pre><code>FUNCTION: filter_policies(policies, ids, tags) → filtered list</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <div class="landmark-detail">
                        <code class="landmark-key">BASELINE</code>
                        <p><strong>BASELINE</strong> declares evolutionary context for a function. It establishes what currently exists, what must be preserved during evolution, and what is being evolved. BASELINE is optional; when absent, the function is treated as greenfield (building something new rather than modifying something existing).</p>
                        <pre><code>BASELINE:
  reference: "current session-based authentication"
  preserve:
    - existing login API contract
    - session timeout behavior (30 minutes)
    - backward compatibility for v1 clients
  evolve:
    - authentication mechanism (target: JWT-based)
    - token refresh (target: rotation on each use)</code></pre>

                        <p>BASELINE contains three required fields when present:</p>
                        <ul class="doc-list">
                            <li><strong>reference</strong>: A description or pointer to the prior state being evolved from. Can be prose or a concrete reference (commit hash, version tag).</li>
                            <li><strong>preserve</strong>: Behaviors, contracts, or properties that must remain unchanged. These become regression tests.</li>
                            <li><strong>evolve</strong>: Capabilities being added or changed. These represent forward progress.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>BASELINE differs from CONSTRAINT. A constraint is a timeless invariant ("all tokens must be signed"). A preserved behavior is relative to a reference point ("the login API response shape was X before, keep it X"). Both can coexist in a specification.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="landmark-detail">
                        <code class="landmark-key">EVAL</code>
                        <p><strong>EVAL</strong> declares how to measure success for a function's examples. It specifies grading approaches and thresholds, particularly distinguishing regression tests (must always pass) from capability tests (measure progress). EVAL is required when BASELINE is present; optional otherwise.</p>
                        <pre><code>EVAL:
  preserve: pass^3
  evolve: pass@5
  grading: code</code></pre>

                        <p>EVAL contains three fields:</p>
                        <ul class="doc-list">
                            <li><strong>preserve</strong>: Threshold for preserved behaviors using <code>pass^k</code> notation (all k trials must pass). Required when BASELINE present.</li>
                            <li><strong>evolve</strong>: Threshold for evolved capabilities using <code>pass@k</code> notation (at least 1 of k attempts must succeed). Required when BASELINE present.</li>
                            <li><strong>grading</strong>: How examples are evaluated: <code>code</code> (deterministic comparison, default), <code>model</code> (LLM-as-judge for subjective outputs), or <code>outcome</code> (verify actual state change). Optional, defaults to <code>code</code>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The threshold notation:</p>
                        <ul class="doc-list">
                            <li><code>pass^k</code> means all k trials must pass. Used for regression tests where consistency is required.</li>
                            <li><code>pass@k</code> means at least 1 of k trials must pass. Used for capability tests where progress is being measured.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>When BASELINE is absent and EVAL is omitted, examples are treated as traditional test cases with implicit <code>code</code> grading and <code>pass^1</code> threshold.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Function Landmarks</h3>
                    <p>These landmarks appear within a FUNCTION block.</p>

                    <div class="landmark-detail">
                        <code class="landmark-key">RULES</code>
                        <p><strong>RULES</strong> describes what the function does. This is behavioral specification: given these inputs, what should happen? Rules are prose, not pseudocode. They describe outcomes, not steps.</p>
                        <pre><code>RULES:
  - if neither ids nor tags provided, return all policies
  - if only ids provided, return policies matching those IDs
  - if only tags provided, return policies with at least one matching tag
  - if both provided, return union of matches, deduplicated</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <div class="landmark-detail">
                        <code class="landmark-key">DONE_WHEN</code>
                        <p><strong>DONE_WHEN</strong> states how an agent knows the work is complete. These are observable criteria, not implementation details. An agent checks these conditions to determine whether to stop or continue.</p>
                        <pre><code>DONE_WHEN:
  - returned list contains exactly the policies matching criteria
  - no duplicates in returned list</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <div class="landmark-detail">
                        <code class="landmark-key">EXAMPLES</code>
                        <p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong> provides concrete input-output pairs. These are mandatory. They serve as test cases, ground truth, and clarification of intent. If the rules are ambiguous, the examples disambiguate.</p>
                        <p>Examples must satisfy coverage criteria:</p>
                        <ul class="doc-list">
                            <li>Every conditional branch in RULES must have at least one example exercising it</li>
                            <li>If a rule uses "or," "optionally," or other alternation, examples must show each path</li>
                            <li>If the same set of examples could be produced by multiple conflicting interpretations of the rules, the specification is ambiguous</li>
                        </ul>
                        <pre><code>EXAMPLES:
  ([p1, p2, p3], none, none) → [p1, p2, p3]          # neither ids nor tags
  ([p1, p2, p3], [p1.id], none) → [p1]               # only ids
  ([p1, p2, p3], none, [python]) → matches with tag  # only tags
  ([p1, p2, p3], [p1.id], [python]) → union          # both provided</code></pre>

                    <div class="landmark-detail">
                        <code class="landmark-key">ERRORS</code>
                        <p><strong>ERRORS</strong> specifies what to do when things go wrong. It maps conditions to responses. This landmark is required. At minimum, it must specify default failure behavior.</p>
                        <p>A valid minimal ERRORS block:</p>
                        <pre><code>ERRORS:
  - any unhandled condition → fail with descriptive message</code></pre>
                        <p>A more complete ERRORS block:</p>
                        <pre><code>ERRORS:
  - policy ID not found → fail with "unknown policy ID: {id}"
  - invalid YAML syntax → fail with "parse error: {details}"
  - any unhandled condition → fail with descriptive message</code></pre>
                        <p>The requirement ensures agents never silently swallow failures during long-running autonomous execution.</p>

                        <p><strong>READS</strong> declares what shared memory this function consumes. When agents coordinate through shared state, this landmark makes dependencies explicit.</p>

                        <p><strong>TRIGGERS</strong> states conditions under which an agent should pick up this work. In swarm architectures where agents poll for available work, triggers help them decide what to do next.</p>

                        <p><strong>NOT_ALLOWED</strong> establishes boundaries. It states what the function must not do, even if it might seem reasonable. Use this sparingly; over-constraining defeats the purpose of implementation opacity.</p>

                        <p><strong>UNCERTAIN</strong> declares conditions under which an agent should signal low confidence rather than proceeding silently. This provides a structured way to handle ambiguity in long-running autonomous workflows.</p>
                        <pre><code>UNCERTAIN:
  - if input format doesn't match any documented pattern → log warning and attempt best-effort parse
  - if multiple valid interpretations exist → pause and request clarification
  - if output would affect more than 100 files → require confirmation before proceeding</code></pre>
                        <p>When UNCERTAIN is absent, agents proceed with best judgment and do not pause. When present, it defines explicit thresholds for caution.</p>
                        <p>UNCERTAIN does not violate the completeness pillar. The specification remains complete—it simply acknowledges that real-world inputs may fall outside documented cases and provides guidance for those situations.</p>

                        <p><strong>DETERMINISM</strong> declares the expected consistency of function outputs. This landmark reduces implementation variance by making explicit whether repeated calls with identical inputs should produce identical outputs.</p>
                        <pre><code>DETERMINISM:
  level: strict
  seed: from input hash</code></pre>

                            <li><strong>level</strong>: One of <code>strict</code> (identical outputs required), <code>structural</code> (same shape, values may vary), or <code>semantic</code> (equivalent meaning, representation may vary). Default when absent is <code>semantic</code>.</li>
                            <li><strong>seed</strong>: How to seed any random elements. Options include <code>from input hash</code> (deterministic based on inputs), <code>from timestamp</code> (reproducible within time window), or <code>none</code> (explicitly non-deterministic).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <pre><code>DETERMINISM:

  vary: ordering of equivalent items, whitespace formatting
  stable: all data values, field presence, error messages</code></pre>

                        <p>The <code>vary</code> and <code>stable</code> fields provide fine-grained control:</p>
                        <ul class="doc-list">
                            <li><strong>vary</strong>: Aspects of output that may differ between calls</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>When DETERMINISM is absent, agents have maximum implementation freedom. When present, it constrains the acceptable variance in implementations.</p>
                        <p>DETERMINISM interacts with EVAL thresholds. A function marked <code>level: strict</code> with <code>pass^k</code> testing ensures k identical runs produce identical results. A function marked <code>level: semantic</code> with <code>pass@k</code> testing allows variance as long as at least one run achieves the desired outcome.</p>

                <!-- Required and Optional -->
                <section class="doc-section" id="required-and-optional">
                    <h2>Required and Optional</h2>
                    <p>Of the sixteen landmarks, five are always required for a valid specification. One additional landmark is conditionally required.</p>

                    <p><strong>FUNCTION</strong> is required because without it there is no work to describe.</p>
                    <p><strong>RULES</strong> is required because without it there is no behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>DONE_WHEN</strong> is required because without it agents cannot know when to stop.</p>
                    <p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong> is required because without them there is no ground truth.</p>
                    <p><strong>ERRORS</strong> is required because without it agents may fail silently during autonomous execution.</p>

                    <p><strong>EVAL</strong> is conditionally required: when BASELINE is present, EVAL must also be present. Without EVAL, BASELINE's preserve/evolve distinction would have no measurement criteria, violating the completeness pillar.</p>

                    <p>Everything else is optional. A minimal valid spec consists of a function with rules, completion criteria, examples, and error handling. A minimal valid evolution spec adds BASELINE and EVAL. The optional landmarks add precision when needed, but their absence does not invalidate a spec.</p>

                    <p><strong>Variance control landmarks.</strong> Three landmarks specifically target implementation variance:</p>
                    <ul class="doc-list">
                        <li><strong>DATA</strong> (as output schema): When a function's return type references a DATA block, outputs must conform exactly</li>
                        <li><strong>CONSTRAINT</strong>: Behavioral anchors that narrow valid implementations</li>
                        <li><strong>DETERMINISM</strong>: Explicit control over output consistency requirements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These are optional but recommended when reducing implementation variance is important.</p>

                    <p>DATA is optional to define. But when a function's return type references a DATA block, conformance is required—the choice to use DATA is optional, the obligation to conform is not.</p>

                <!-- Validation Criteria -->
                <section class="doc-section" id="validation-criteria">
                    <h2>Validation Criteria</h2>
                    <p>A specification is valid if it passes structural and semantic validation.</p>

                    <h3>Structural Validation</h3>
                    <ul class="doc-list">
                        <li>At least one FUNCTION block exists</li>
                        <li>Every FUNCTION contains RULES, DONE_WHEN, EXAMPLES, and ERRORS</li>
                        <li>DATA types referenced in FUNCTION signatures are defined or obvious from context</li>
                        <li>CONSTRAINT blocks state verifiable invariants</li>
                        <li>If BASELINE is present, it must contain reference, preserve, and evolve</li>
                        <li>If BASELINE is present, EVAL must also be present</li>
                        <li>If EVAL is present with BASELINE, it must contain preserve and evolve thresholds</li>
                        <li>EVAL.grading must be one of: code, model, outcome</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Semantic Validation</h3>
                    <p>Semantic validation ensures the specification is unambiguous.</p>

                    <p><strong>Example coverage.</strong> Every conditional path in RULES must be exercised by at least one example.</p>
                    <ul class="doc-list">
                        <li>Count the branches: "if X" is one branch; "if X or Y" is two branches; "if X, else Y" is two branches</li>
                        <li>Each branch needs at least one example demonstrating it</li>
                        <li>Missing coverage is a validation error</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Interpretation uniqueness.</strong> The examples must not be satisfiable by conflicting interpretations.</p>
                    <ul class="doc-list">
                        <li>If an agent could imagine two different implementations that both pass all examples but would behave differently on some unstated input, the specification is ambiguous</li>
                        <li>This is a heuristic, not a formal proof—agents should flag suspected ambiguity</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Observable completion.</strong> DONE_WHEN criteria must be checkable from outside the function.</p>
                    <ul class="doc-list">
                        <li>"Internal state is consistent" is not observable—invalid</li>
                        <li>"Output contains no duplicates" is observable—valid</li>
                        <li>"All items processed" is observable only if processing produces visible evidence—clarify</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Behavioral rules.</strong> RULES must describe outcomes, not procedures.</p>
                    <ul class="doc-list">
                        <li>"Loop through items and check each" is procedural—invalid</li>
                        <li>"All items matching criteria are included in output" is behavioral—valid</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Evolution coverage.</strong> When BASELINE is present, every item in preserve and evolve should have at least one corresponding example.</p>
                    <ul class="doc-list">
                        <li>Preserved behaviors need examples that verify regression protection</li>
                        <li>Evolved capabilities need examples that demonstrate the new behavior</li>
                        <li>Examples should be classifiable as testing preserved vs. evolved behavior based on what they exercise</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <!-- Composition -->
                <section class="doc-section" id="composition">
                    <h2>Composition</h2>
                    <p>Simplex does not have a composition construct. There is no way to formally specify that one function calls another, or that functions must execute in a particular order.</p>

                    <p><strong>Design Note:</strong> This is intentional and represents a research hypothesis. Simplex is designed for autonomous agent workflows where agents operate over extended periods. The hypothesis is that agents can infer task dependencies and decomposition from context, potentially discovering structures the specification author did not anticipate. Prescribed composition would constrain this emergent behavior.</p>

                    <p>If a spec author wants to suggest relationships between functions, they can:</p>
                    <ul class="doc-list">
                        <li>Use READS/WRITES to show data dependencies</li>
                        <li>Use TRIGGERS to show activation conditions</li>
                        <li>Write prose in HANDOFF describing what the next stage expects</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>But Simplex does not enforce ordering. Agents determine sequencing based on their understanding of the full specification.</p>
                    <p>This design choice is experimental. Future versions may revisit it based on empirical results from autonomous agent research.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Shared Memory -->
                <section class="doc-section" id="shared-memory">
                    <h2>Shared Memory</h2>
                    <p>When agents coordinate through shared state—a knowledge graph, a key-value store, a file system—the READS, WRITES, and TRIGGERS landmarks describe interaction patterns.</p>
                    <p>However, Simplex does not define what shared memory is or how it works. It only provides landmarks for describing contracts against it. The implementation of shared memory is an agent concern.</p>
                    <p>A specification might say:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <div class="code-header">
                            <span class="code-language">simplex</span>
                            <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyCode(this)">Copy</button>
                        </div>
                        <pre><code>READS:
  - SharedMemory.knowledge_graph (policy relationships)

WRITES:
  - SharedMemory.artifacts["compiled_output"]</code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>Whether SharedMemory is a graph database, a Redis instance, or a directory of JSON files is not the spec's concern. The contract is that something called SharedMemory exists, supports these operations, and agents can rely on it.</p>

                    <h2>Usage Guidance</h2>
                    <p>When writing a Simplex specification, start with the function signature and examples. The examples force clarity about inputs and outputs before you describe behavior. Many specification errors become obvious when you try to write concrete examples.</p>
                    <p>Next, write the rules. Describe behavior, not implementation. If you catch yourself writing "loop through" or "create a variable," step back. Describe what should be true of the output, not how to compute it.</p>
                    <p>Then write the completion criteria. These should be observable from outside the function. "Internal data structure is consistent" is not observable. "Output contains no duplicates" is observable.</p>
                    <p>Write the error handling. At minimum, specify that unhandled conditions fail with descriptive messages. For functions with known failure modes, map specific conditions to specific responses.</p>
                    <p>Add optional landmarks only as needed. A simple function may need nothing beyond the required five. A function that interacts with shared memory or has complex coordination needs benefits from READS, WRITES, TRIGGERS. A function operating in uncertain environments benefits from UNCERTAIN.</p>
                    <p>If a specification becomes unwieldy, decompose it. Multiple simple specs are better than one complex spec. If the linter flags complexity errors, that is a signal to break the work into smaller pieces.</p>
                    <p>Run the linter before considering a specification complete. A spec that passes linting has met the structural and semantic requirements for validity.</p>

                <section class="doc-section" id="version-history">
                    <h2>Version History</h2>
                    <p><strong>v0.5</strong> — Current version. Added variance reduction features. Enhanced CONSTRAINT as behavioral anchors with examples of state invariants, output guarantees, and boundary conditions. Added DETERMINISM landmark for explicit control over output consistency (strict/structural/semantic levels, seed specification, vary/stable fields). Strengthened DATA as required output schemas—when a function return type references a DATA block, outputs must conform exactly. Added <code>not allowed</code> field annotation and conditional field presence. Added linter functions check_determinism and check_output_schema. Updated meta-specification and validation for new landmarks.</p>
                    <p><em>v0.5 variance reduction features address the gap between specification intent and implementation variance. When agents have implementation freedom, outputs can vary in structure, ordering, and detail even when semantically equivalent. These landmarks provide spec authors with tools to constrain variance where consistency matters.</em></p>
                    <p><strong>v0.4</strong> — Added BASELINE and EVAL landmarks for evolutionary specifications. BASELINE declares what to preserve and evolve relative to a reference state. EVAL declares grading approach and consistency thresholds using pass^k (all trials must pass) and pass@k (at least one trial must pass) notation. These landmarks address agent failure modes in long-horizon software evolution scenarios. EVAL is required when BASELINE is present to ensure measurement criteria are explicit. Added linter functions for BASELINE/EVAL validation and evolution coverage checking. Updated meta-specification for conditional landmark requirements.</p>
                    <p><em>v0.4 landmark additions informed by SWE-EVO research [1].</em></p>
                    <p><strong>v0.3</strong> — Made ERRORS required. Added UNCERTAIN landmark for confidence signaling. Added Validation Criteria section with semantic ambiguity detection. Added Linter Specification. Clarified that composition absence is an intentional research hypothesis. Updated meta-specification for new requirements.</p>
                    <p><strong>v0.2</strong> — Established pillars, landmarks, interpretation model, and meta-specification.</p>
                    <p><strong>v0.1</strong> — Initial exploration. Identified need for specification targeting autonomous agents.</p>
